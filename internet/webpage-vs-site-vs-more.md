- **Definition:** A single document on the internet, typically written in HTML, that displays information such as text, images, videos, or links.
- **Example:** The page you’re reading right now or `https://example.com/about`.

#### **Layman Explanation:**
A webpage is like a single page in a book. It contains content about a specific topic, and it’s part of something bigger (like a website).

#### **Key Features:**
- Can be static (fixed content) or dynamic (content that changes, often powered by backend code and databases).
- Loaded in a browser when you visit a URL (e.g., `https://example.com/page1`).

### **2. Website**
- **Definition:** A collection of interconnected webpages hosted under a single domain name.
- **Example:** `www.wikipedia.org` is a website, and its pages like `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet` are its webpages.

#### **Layman Explanation:**
A website is like an entire book that contains many pages (webpages). It provides a complete set of information or services.

#### **Key Features:**
- Has a home page (the main entry point) and multiple subpages.

### **3. Web Server**
- **Definition:** A computer that stores and delivers webpages to users when they request them via a browser.
- **Example:** Apache, Nginx, or Microsoft IIS are common web server software.

#### **Layman Explanation:**
A web server is like a restaurant kitchen. When you (the user) place an order (request a webpage), the kitchen (server) prepares and sends the dish (webpage) to you.

#### **How It Works:**
1. A user’s browser sends an HTTP/HTTPS request to the server for a specific page.
2. The web server processes the request, retrieves the required files, and sends them back.
3. The browser renders the page for the user.

#### **Web Server Software:**
- Examples:
  - **Apache:** Popular for hosting websites.
  - **Nginx:** Known for speed and handling high traffic.

### **4. Website vs. Web Server**
- **Website:** The content you see and interact with (the book and its pages).
- **Web Server:** The computer that makes that content accessible to users on the internet (the kitchen preparing and serving the book’s pages).

### **5. Search Engine**
- **Definition:** A tool or platform that helps users find information on the internet by indexing websites and displaying relevant results.

#### **Layman Explanation:**
A search engine is like a librarian who knows every book (website) in the library (internet) and helps you find the specific book or page you need.

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Crawling:** Search engines use bots (called crawlers) to scan the internet and discover webpages.
2. **Indexing:** Information from these pages is organized in a massive database for quick retrieval.
3. **Ranking:** When you search, the engine ranks results based on relevance, keywords, popularity, and other factors.
4. **Results:** It displays a list of links to webpages matching your query.

#### **Key Features:**
